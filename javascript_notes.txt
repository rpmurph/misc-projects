let cities = ['Nashville', 'Charlotte', 'Asheville', 'Austin', 'Boulder'];

let nums = [1, 50, 75, 200, 350, 525, 1000];

//  Choose a method that will return undefined
cities.forEach(city => console.log('Have you visited ' + city + '?'));

// Choose a method that will return a new array
let longCities = cities.filter(city => city.length > 7);

// Choose a method that will return a new array
let smallerNums = nums.map(num => num - 5);

// Choose a method that will return a boolean value
nums.every(num => num < 0);


Notes:

    .forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and returns undefined.

    .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.

    .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.

    All iterator methods can be written using arrow function syntax. In fact, given the succinctness and the implicit return of arrow function syntax, this is quickly becoming the preferred way to write these types of method calls.

    You can visit the Mozilla Developer Network to learn more about iterator methods (and all other parts of JavaScript!).

    Additional iterator methods such as .some(), .every(), .reduce() perform different functions.
